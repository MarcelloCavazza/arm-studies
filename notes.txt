Registers:
are ares in memory that are very close to the cpu(fast), but its limited to eight hexadecimal values(hexadecimal = 4 bit)
8 decimal slots, each 4 bits = 32 bit computer

word = max size of a register

r0-r6 = general porpouse

r7 = ask the cpu to do something

sp= stack pointer, always tell the next available piece of memeory on the stack. the next address of a value is always 4 higher

stack memory = stored in ram

link register = stores the location of the location that a function should return

pc = program counter, keep track of the next instrucion to execute

cpsr = has flags that tell special information about operations(eg: a sum returned pos or neg)
